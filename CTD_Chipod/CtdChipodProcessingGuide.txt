This is a guide to processing data from chi pods deployed on CTD rosettes. Processing software is part of the ‘mixingsoftware’ github repo maintained by the OSU ocean mixing group. For latest version, download/sync the mixingsoftware github repo at https://github.com/OceanMixingGroup/mixingsoftware.



(1) CTD Data processing

First, CTD data is required for chi pod processing. See ‘ctd_processing’ folder in mixing software. 

(2) Chipod processing

(a) Chipod deployment info. Copy ‘Chipod_Deploy_Info_template.m’; and rename for your cruise. Enter/edit info for chi pods deployed on your cruise. Note: Sometimes this info might change during the cruise (a sensor needs to be swapped out, or a chi pod is changed to up or down). If this is the case, the best option is probably to put in a special statement in the processing script.

(b) Chipod processing script. Copy ‘’ and rename for your cruise. Edit paths and info for your cruise. Lines of code that need to be modified are indicated by ‘~~~’ in the template.
