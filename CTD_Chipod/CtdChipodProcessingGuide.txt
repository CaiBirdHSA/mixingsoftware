This is a guide to processing data from chi pods deployed on CTD rosettes. The processing software is part of the ‘mixingsoftware’ github repo maintained by the OSU ocean mixing group. For latest version, download/sync the mixingsoftware github repo at https://github.com/OceanMixingGroup/mixingsoftware.

The processing software and methods are in development; please notify us of any issues you encounter at the email above.


(1) CTD Data processing

First, CTD data is required for chi pod processing. See ‘ctd_processing’ folder in mixing software. Note that the 24hz, as well as the binned (usually 1 m) CTD data is required for chi pod processing.

(2) Chipod processing

(a) Chipod deployment info. Copy ‘Chipod_Deploy_Info_template.m’; and rename for your cruise. Enter/edit info for chi pods deployed on your cruise. Note: Sometimes this info might change during the cruise (a sensor needs to be swapped out, or a chi pod is changed to up or down). If this is the case, the best option is probably to put in a special statement in the processing script.

(b) Chipod processing script. Copy ‘process_chipod_script_template.m’ and rename for your cruise. Edit paths and info for your specific cruise. Lines of code that need to be modified are indicated by ‘~~~’ in the template.
