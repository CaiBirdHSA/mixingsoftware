m-files used by the Ocean Mixing Group at OSU

mixingsoftware contains all of the MATLAB code to process and plot data collected by the Ocean Mixing Group.

This software is used by many people, all who may update code when they find bugs. It is necessary for these changes to be distributed among the group so everyone is using the latest versions of the code.

For a user who never plans to update the code, you can just download a .zip file of mixingsoftware by going to github.com and searching for mixingsoftware. The link to download is on the lower right of the screen.

For MOST users who will update the code and want to be notified when changes are made, you will need to follow these steps:
1. go to github.com and install GitHub on your computer
2. create a username and password
