mixingsoftware
==============

m-files used by the Ocean Mixing Group at OSU

mixingsoftware contains all of the MATLAB code to process and plot data collected by the Ocean Mixing Group. You are welcome to use the code if you find it useful via zip download.

This software is used by scientists in the group who hopefully update code when they find bugs â€¦ OMG, it happens! It is necessary for these changes to be distributed among the group so everyone is using the latest versions of the code. For now, outside users will not have the ability to update code - we would like them to but not sure at present how to   do the necessary quality control before accepting code updates. 

New code (for graphics, for example) can be submitted to a group member who can add it to the library. Add your name/date/contact_info to the script.  

You can download a .zip file of mixingsoftware by going to github.com and searching for mixingsoftware. The link to download is on the lower right of the screen.

For MOST users who will update the code and want to be notified when changes are made, you will need to follow these steps:
1. go to github.com and install GitHub on your computer
2. create a username and password
