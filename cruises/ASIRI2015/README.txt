ASIRI2015

This folder contains m-files from August 2015 ASIRI cruise on R/V Revelle (RR1513). Starting point will be m-files from scienceparty_share that was used on cruise. Data will eventually be hosted on servers somewhere tbd; going forward all paths in m-files should be made relative to ‘SciencePath’ , which is the path to the scienceparty_share archive and can be specified at the beginning of m-files.
