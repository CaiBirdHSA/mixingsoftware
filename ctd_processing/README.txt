ctd_processing

This folder is part of the OSU Ocean Mixing Group ‘mixing software’ github repository. It was added by A. Pickering on April 21, 2015.

This folder contains Matlab codes to process raw data files from Seabird CTDs that are deployed on most of the UNOLs ships.

The starting point for this folder was the folder ctd_proc2 from Jen MacKinnon (Scripps). Some of the core functions within this folder were written by Dan Rudnick, Shaun Johnston, and Robert Todd.
