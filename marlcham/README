MATLAB 5.1 CALIBRATION ROUTINES

version 1.01 
July 1998
Jonathan Nash

TO USE:
1) SET a MATLAB path to /home/nalu/shared/matview/cal/
2) Copy the files README, MASTER_CAL.M and CALI_SCRIPT.M to a working
directory 
3) Modify MASTER_CAL.M and CALI_SCRIPT for your own use


The structure of this program is as follows:

MASTER_CAL.M:   (~banal.cfg)
-program loops through different filenames by assigning q.script.num,
q.script.prefix, and q.script.pathname such as: 

q.script.num=67;
q.script.prefix='ch98a';
q.script.pathname='/home/nalu/data1/ch98a/raw/';

After this, execute:
RAW_LOAD to load the data into the variables DATA and HEAD.

All variables are calibrated in CALI_SCRIPT.M (~cal.cfg) where the
functions CALIBRATE and CALIBRATE_* are called to calibrate
variables.  Calibrated variables must be stored in the structure CAL
and new variables must have HEAD.IREP.* defined (which represents the
sample rate: 1,2,4, etc) if they are to be used by other subroutines.

Average values of variables and the determination of epsilon, etc, are
obtained by AVERAGE_DATA.M, which puts the averages into a structure
AVG.


Finally, the data is saved using SAVE, SAVE_MATFILE.M (to save to
structured variables) or SAVE_MATVIEW_FILE.M to save to unstructured
variables.
